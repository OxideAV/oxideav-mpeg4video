# oxideav-mpeg4video

A pure-Rust MPEG-4 Part 2 Video codec for the
[oxideav](https://github.com/OxideAV/oxideav) framework.

## Status

**Orphan-rebuild scaffold (2026-05-18).** The prior implementation was
retired under the workspace
[clean-room policy](https://github.com/OxideAV/oxideav/blob/master/docs/IMPLEMENTOR_ROUND.md):
the VLC table modules acknowledged that their numerical entries were
sourced from an external library's data tables — clean-room provenance
for the table values could not be defended. Master history was fully
erased per the Hat-3 cold-enforcement procedure.

The implementation will be re-built against the published MPEG-4
Visual specification (ISO/IEC 14496-2) in a future clean-room round.
